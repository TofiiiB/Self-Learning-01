    <h1>Interstellar</h1>
    <p>One of my favorite movies is Interstellar. Everything about the movie was intriguing, challenging, 
        and most importantly mind boggling.

    <h1>Avengers: Endgame</h1>
    <p>Although it is a superhero movie, the entire culmination of the MCU, in its entirety
        broken down and getting its conclusion, is just, chefs kiss. Mwah.

    <h1>Real Steel</h1>
    <p>Its just nostalgic, I used to watch it alot during drives with my patents.
